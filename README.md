5. **E-commerce Test** - Shopping cart and checkout simulation
6. **Support Portal Test** - Help desk and support feature testing
7. **Form Submission Test** - Multiple form type testing

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- Internet connection

### Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/LRGEX-Web-Benchmark.git
   cd LRGEX-Web-Benchmark
   ```

2. **Run LRGEX:**

   ```bash
   python LRGEX-Benchmark.py
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive setup:**

   - Choose your test type (1-7)
   - Answer simple questions about your website
   - Select Interactive or Automatic mode
   - Start testing!

### Troubleshooting: Fresh Windows Systems

If the script installs UV successfully but then says "Cannot proceed without UV":

1. **Restart your PowerShell/Terminal** and run the script again:

   ```bash
   python LRGEX-Benchmark.py
   ```

2. **Or manually update PATH** in your current session:
   ```powershell
   $env:Path = "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin;$env:Path"
   python LRGEX-Benchmark.py
   ```

This happens because UV installs correctly but isn't immediately available in the current shell session. This is normal for fresh Windows installations and only occurs once.

4. **View results:**
   - Open `http://localhost:8089` for real-time control
   - Check `reports/` folder for detailed results

## Example: Smart Form Builder

```
Select test type (1-7): 1
Enter your website URL: https://mysite.com
Form page: /contact
Submit URL: /submit-contact
Number of fields: 3

Field 1 name: name
Data type: Person's name (3)

Field 2 name: email
Data type: Email address (4)

Field 3 name: message
Data type: Text message (6)

## What This Tool Monitors

### ‚úÖ What LRGEX Web Benchmark Tracks:

- **Response times** (how fast your website responds)
- **Success/failure rates** (which requests work vs. fail)
- **Throughput** (requests per second)
- **Request statistics** (min, max, median response times)
- **Real-time performance graphs** in the web interface

### ‚ùå What This Tool Does NOT Monitor:

- **Server CPU usage** - You need server monitoring tools
- **Memory consumption** - Check your server's task manager/htop
- **Disk I/O** - Use server monitoring or system tools
- **Network bandwidth** - Monitor at your server/router level
- **Database performance** - Requires separate database monitoring

### How to Monitor Server Resources:

- **Windows Server**: Task Manager, Performance Monitor, or tools like New Relic
- **Linux Server**: htop, iostat, sar, or monitoring solutions like Grafana
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring
- **Web Hosting**: Check your hosting provider's control panel

## What This Tool Does

The LRGEX Web Benchmark tool simulates multiple users accessing your website simultaneously to:

- **Test server capacity** under realistic load conditions
- **Identify performance bottlenecks** before they affect real users
- **Validate form submissions** work correctly under load
- **Measure response times** and success rates
- **Generate detailed reports** for performance analysis

## Understanding Test Results

### Key Metrics Explained

| Metric           | Description                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **# Requests**   | Total number of HTTP requests sent     |
| **# Fails**      | Number of failed requests (aim for 0)  |
| **Median (ms)**  | Response time for 50% of requests      |
| **95%ile (ms)**  | Response time for 95% of requests      |
| **Average (ms)** | Mean response time across all requests |
| **Current RPS**  | Requests per second (throughput)       |

### What Constitutes Good Performance?

- **0% failure rate**: All requests should succeed
- **Response times under 500ms**: Good user experience
- **Consistent performance**: Small difference between median and 95th percentile
- **High throughput**: Server can handle expected user load

### Sample Results Interpretation

```
Type    Name           # Requests  # Fails  Median(ms)  95%ile(ms)  Current RPS
GET     /admin.html    15933       0        90          390         696
```

**Analysis**: Excellent performance with 0 failures, fast response times (90ms median), and high throughput (696 RPS).

## Best Practices

### Before Testing

- **Only test websites you own** or have explicit permission to test
- **Start with low user counts** (10-50 users) and gradually increase
- **Test during off-peak hours** to avoid affecting real users
- **Inform your team** when conducting load tests

### During Testing

- **Monitor server resources separately** (use your server's monitoring tools for CPU, memory, disk I/O)
- **Watch the Locust interface** for error rates and response times
- **Gradually increase load** to find breaking points
- **Stop tests immediately** if issues arise

### After Testing

- **Analyze reports thoroughly** to identify bottlenecks
- **Document findings** and share with your team
- **Plan optimizations** based on results
- **Re-test after making improvements**

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Important Warning

**Only test websites you own or have explicit written permission to test.**

Load testing without permission may be considered:

- **Denial of Service (DoS) attack**
- **Violation of terms of service**
- **Potentially illegal** depending on jurisdiction

### Responsible Testing

- Test your own applications and infrastructure
- Obtain written permission before testing third-party sites
- Use realistic load scenarios, not excessive stress tests
- Respect rate limits and server resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port 8089 already in use**:

- Another Locust instance is running
- Kill the process or restart your computer

**Connection errors**:

- Verify the target URL is accessible
- Check firewall and network settings
- Ensure the website is online

**High failure rates**:

- Server may be overloaded
- Reduce user count or spawn rate
- Check server logs for errors

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify your network connection
3. Ensure you have permission to test the target site
4. Review the generated test files in the `tests/` directory
